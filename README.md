### technical plan 1.
We will have an outer html which simulates the user's webpage
We will create a JavaScript code which will attach itself to the component with the id="quiz" and generate the course just like react
You are supposed to append to the javascript to handle the logic that should happen once you finish this "chapter"
This will be created using classes since I never use them because OOP is retarted but who cares
